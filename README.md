# Visualisation-of-Indian-Crime-data
Implemented a web-based interactive visualization tool for visualizing crime data related to women. The data was taken from https://data.gov.in/ and http://ncrb.gov.in. 
# DataSet

-Bar Chart for state-wise comparison.
-Line Chart for showing trends.
-Anotation box- for showing scenes.

  # Brushing & Linking:

                        -based on Number of cases reported.
                        -based on Crime Rate.
